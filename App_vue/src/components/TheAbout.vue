        <h1>The Game</h1>
        <p>
          A group of VFS students working on our game Catatonic, a 2.5D High Fantasy Noir Dungeon Crawler.
           Features include Magic Saxophone Combat: Players cast spells using a magic saxophone, as well as a 
           High Fantasy Noir Setting: A blend of high fantasy elements with dark mysterious noir themes. Players will have to master spell combinations and 
           strategic use of the magic saxophone.
