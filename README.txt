## **Basic Framework for Live Ops Web App**

---

### **Download/Install**
- Clone the repository: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vfs-sct/a1-3-telemetry-system-pg25tommy.git)
- [Download Zip](https://github.com/vfs-sct/a1-3-telemetry-system-pg25tommy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- Open the files in Visual Studio Code
- Launch the project using Live Server

---

### **How to Use**
- Navigate through the app using the navigation menu to explore different pages.

---

### **Intent**
- I retained much of the base functionality and style because it was intuitive and aligned with my vision for the app. Since the assignment requirements weren't explicitly clear on how much we were expected to modify, I was cautious about removing existing elements. I added charts and dummy data as a head start for future development. While I'm not certain if they should be included at this stage, I opted to leave them in for now.

- I plan to implement the necessary adjustments for Assignment 2 based on feedback.

---

### **Known Issues**
- The navigation has not been modularized into its own component. I found the base navigation suitable for this stage, but I apologize if this wasn't the correct approach.

- The "Reload Charts" button is currently non-functional. I'm uncertain how to properly link it with the dummy JSON data. Could you please provide further guidance on how to expand this functionality?
